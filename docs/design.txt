Assignment 1 Morse-to-ASCII Documentation

Programs:
main_to_morse - Translates ASCII input to Morse
main_to_ascii - Translates Morse input to ASCII

Functionality:
Each program will read in a line of input from STD_IN and write the translation to STD_OUT
Information about each letter of the alphabet will be stored in a struct: letter
letter {
    char c: ascii char representation
    sequence: a boolean array of the morse representation
    morse: a string literal of the morse representation (dots and dashes)
    length: sequence length of the morse representation
}

Morse protocol:
00 - End of character
01 - Morse dash
10 - Morse dot
11 - space character
0000 - End of transmission

Noted limitations:
1)  end of character + end of transmission (000000) will be read as simply end of transmission and cut off 2 00's.
    Estimated impact: none.
2) '*' and 'X' have the same morse values. They will be encoded in the same sequence. Decoding this sequence, by convention, will always decode to 'X'.
    Reason: 'X' can be used as both a letter and a multiplication symbol (the two primary uses). The alternative is to modify the program
    to intelligently use message context around that char to interpret it correctly. This is beyond the scope of this project.
    Estimated impact: minimal.
